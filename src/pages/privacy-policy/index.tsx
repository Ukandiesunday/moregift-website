                We have implemented reasonable and appropriate measures to
                secure your personal information from accidental loss and from
                unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. The Site
                is hosted on secure servers provided by our hosting services
                provider in the United States ("US"). By using the Site or
                providing us with any information, you acknowledge that the
                processing of your information, including personal information,
                will take place in the US as set forth in this notice and our
                Terms and Conditions of Service or other agreement between you

                The safety and security of your information also depend on you.
                For example, where we have given you (or where you have chosen)
                a password and PIN for access and verification to certain parts
                of the Site, you are responsible for keeping this password and
                PIN confidential.

                Unfortunately, the transmission of information online is not
                completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of your
                personal information transmitted to or through the Site, which

                At moregift, we are committed to upholding your choices
                regarding the use and disclosure of your personal information.
                You can contact us at any time to request limitations on how we
                use and disclose your personal data. However, it's important to
                note that, as MoreGift provides services primarily to
                individuals on behalf of their employers, and often collects
                personal information directly from these employers, your
                employer may be a more effective point of contact for such
                requests. We encourage you to engage with your employer first if
                you wish to limit the use or disclosure of your data.

              <h2>Data retention and deletion</h2>
              <p>
                The Company retains user profile, and other personal data for as
                long as a user maintains their account and except as otherwise
                permitted or required by applicable law or regulation, only for
                as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes the Company
                collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any
                legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Company may also retain certain information, if necessary,
                for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention. For
                example, if the Company deactivates a User’s account because of
                unsafe behavior or security incidents, the Company may retain
                certain information about that account to prevent that User from
                opening a new account in the future.
              </p>
              <p>
                Users may request deletion of their account at any time.
                Following such requests, the Company deletes the data that it is
                not required to retain for purposes of regulatory, insurance,
                litigation, or other legal requirements. For example, the
                Company retains location, device, and usage data for these
                purposes for a minimum of 7 years; while it retains such data,
                it may also use it for purposes of safety, security, fraud
                prevention and detection, and research and development.
              </p>
              <p>

                Under some circumstances, the Company may anonymize Users'
                personal information so that it can no longer be associated with
                a particular User. The Company reserves the right to use such
                anonymous and de-identified data for any legitimate business
                purpose without further notice to the relevant User or its
                consent.
